## 5) Cost Control Rules
- Default model: **Kimi K2.5**
- Escalate to **Sonnet** for writing/analysis
- Use **Opus** for architecture/strategy only
- Hard cap hourly requests via rate-limit panel
- Daily cost review at end of day

## 6) Stripe Integration Checklist
- Add Stripe keys to `config/business.json`
- Create products (Starter/Pro/Enterprise)
- Enable webhook endpoint for:
  - checkout.session.completed
  - customer.subscription.updated
  - customer.subscription.deleted
- Test in Stripe sandbox first

## 7) Operations SOP
- Morning: review errors, queue, rate limits
- Midday: process high-priority tasks
- Evening: optimize model usage + margins
- Hourly: auto-commit + backup

## 8) KPIs to Track
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Activation rate (% completing first task)
- Cost per completed task
- Gross margin (revenue - API costs)
- Avg task completion time
- Churn rate (monthly)
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)
- LTV (Lifetime Value)
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

## 9) Launch Sequence
- Day 1: soft launch with 3 pilot users
- Day 2-3: tune pricing + onboarding copy
- Day 4-7: public launch + testimonials

## 10) Risk Controls
- If rate-limited: queue tasks + switch cheaper model
- If dashboard down: restart service + fallback to local scripts
- If costs spike: pause Opus + enforce Kimi-only mode
- If churn spikes: immediate survey + retention offers
